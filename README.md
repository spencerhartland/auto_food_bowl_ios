#  Automatic Pet Food Bowl â€“ iOS App

**Note**: This project is a work in progress, it will change!

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the companion iOS app to the linux-powered automatic pet food bowl I'm developing. The app is not required for operation, but enables on-demand feeding, remote monitoring, and rich customization. The app is written entirely in Swift / SwiftUI and communicates with the food bowl via Wi-Fi.
